# The Zink Project

Zink is a native, user-mode application. It's main focus is to zoom in/out 
screen using mouse wheel. It currently only supports Windows(x64) operating 
system. In the future it may expand to also support native Linux system.

Zink is currently in *ALPHA*. Some features may come and go time to time. The
Zink project aims to reduce the friction between user and their visual 
workspace, providing a seamless and intuitive way to magnify on-screen content 
without breaking workflow or performance.

You can download pre-built binaries for Zink

# Development Setup Instructions

> Note: Currently, only x64 Windows development is supported.
### 1. Install the required tools
- MSVC
- Window SDK

### 2. Build Environment Setup
Building the codebase can be done in a terminal which is equipped with the
ability to call MSVC.

This is generally done by calling `vcvarsall.bat x64`, which is included in the
Microsoft C/C++ Build Tools. This script is automatically called by the `x64
Native Tools Command Prompt for VS <year>` variant of the vanilla `cmd.exe`. If
you've installed the build tools, this command prompt may be easily located by
searching for `Native` from the Windows Start Menu search.

### 3. Building
Within the `cmd`, cd to the root directory of the codebase and just run the
`build.bat` script
```
build
```
The entire project should build in _less than 3 seconds_ and you're good to go.
You can find the executable in the `build` directory.
